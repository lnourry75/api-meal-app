# api-meal-app

Welcome to meal app !


Here you can order your meal by selecting a cooking ingredient and all our meals based on this ingredient will be displayed with a picture of the meal and his name. When you click on the image or the title of the meal you can consult the details of it such as the country of origin, the category, the ingredients needed, the instruction and a link to the youtube video on : How to cook this meal ? . (meal recipe). 
If you click on the cross you can go back on the list of meals and select a new one or you can always search for a meal based on other ingredients.
I wanted to put the youtube videos directly on the site in iframe but I had a problem that I couldn't solve then I displayed them with an href link.


For the cocktail API the method is the same with a form that displays all the cocktails that contain the selected ingredient.
However when you click on the image or the title of the cocktail you have access to the category of the cocktail, the ingredients necessary to make it, the instructions for his composition and an indicator to know if the cocktail is alcoholic or not.
There is also a cross to return to the display of all the cocktails.



Good Tasting !  :D
